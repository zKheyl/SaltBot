#SaltBot
======================

By Dubois Jérémy and Ferreira Mendes Adrien

The idea is to create a bot being able to obtain informations about a game quickly.
The game is "League of Legends". The bot can give the kda of a player over his last
20 games. It can also tell if a player is in a game or not. Finally, it can inform
the user of the state of the EUWEST server. 
To do so the bot possess three commands to answer the users. those have been 
implemented by using the API of "RIOT" and "discord.py".
